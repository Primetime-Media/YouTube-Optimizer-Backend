      "prompt": "**TRANSFORMATION PROMPT:**\n\nReimagine the provided image as a high-octane YouTube thumbnail for a video titled \"Testing What Happens If You Jump On A Moving Train.\" The final image should be in a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\n**1. FRAME COMPOSITION & FOCAL POINT:**\n*   **Subject Repositioning & Scaling:** The male subject should be the primary focal point, significantly larger in the frame than in the original. Position him slightly off-center, adhering to the rule of thirds, perhaps more towards the left or right third line, to create dynamic tension. He should appear to be in the midst of a dramatic action \u2013 either just landing from a jump, or bracing powerfully against the train's motion.\n*   **Camera Angle:** Shift to a slightly lower angle, looking up at the subject on the train, to make the action feel more imposing and dangerous. The train should still be clearly identifiable as a massive, powerful vehicle.\n*   **Background Simplification:** The distant background (trees, farm, buildings) should be significantly blurred and slightly desaturated to ensure the subject and train pop.\n\n**2. VISUAL ELEMENTS & ENHANCEMENTS:**\n*   **Main Subject Enhancement:**\n    *   **Pose:** The subject's pose should be highly dynamic and exaggerated for dramatic effect \u2013 legs wide for balance, arms out or tensed, body leaning into the motion.\n    *   **Facial Expression:** His face should be clearly visible (even if it requires slight artistic license from the original blurry face) and convey intense emotion: a mix of shock, adrenaline, and determination (e.g., wide eyes, gritted teeth, or a focused yell).\n    *   **Clothing:** Enhance the contrast and saturation of his clothing. If his clothes are dull, make them slightly more vibrant (e.g., deepen the black of his jacket, make his pants a cleaner khaki or even a slightly more saturated color that contrasts with the yellow train). Add subtle highlights and shadows to define his form.\n*   **Train Enhancement:**\n    *   **Color:** Intensify the bright yellow (#FFD700) of the \"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY\" train, making it very vibrant. Sharpen the black stripes and lettering for maximum contrast.\n    *   **Details:** Add subtle metallic reflections and highlights on the train's surface to give it a more tangible, powerful presence.\n*   **Motion & Speed:**\n    *   Introduce strong motion blur streaks to the train wheels (if visible) and the immediate ground/track area passing by.\n    *   Subtle speed lines/wind effects around the subject and trailing slightly behind the train to emphasize its velocity.\n\n**3. COLOR & LIGHTING:**\n*   **Overall Palette:** High contrast, vibrant, and attention-grabbing.\n*   **Primary Colors:** Dominant vibrant yellow (#FFD700) of the train, strong blacks, and the subject's clothing colors.\n*   **Lighting:** Dramatic, almost cinematic lighting. Add a strong key light source, perhaps as if the sun is breaking through clouds, casting defined shadows and highlights on the subject and train. Introduce a subtle rim light around the subject to help separate him from the train and background.\n*   **Contrast:** Significantly increase overall contrast. Aim for deep blacks and bright highlights, especially on the subject and the train.\n*   **Mood Enhancement:** Use color grading to evoke excitement and danger. Slightly warmer tones on the subject and train, cooler tones for the blurred background.\n\n**4. TEXT & TYPOGRAPHY (Optional, but Recommended):**\n*   **Text Content (Example):** \"RISKY JUMP!\" or \"TRAIN SURFING GONE WILD!\" (Keep it 3-4 words max).\n*   **Font Selection:** Use a bold, impactful, sans-serif font like \"Impact,\" \"Bebas Neue,\" or \"Anton.\"\n*   **Size and Weight:** Very large and bold, easily readable at thumbnail size.\n*   **Color and Effects:** Bright white (#FFFFFF) or vibrant yellow (#FFFF00) text with a thick black (#000000) outline and a subtle drop shadow to make it pop against any background.\n*   **Positioning:** Place text in the top left or top center, ensuring it doesn't obscure the subject's face or the core action. Angle it slightly (5-10 degrees) for added dynamism.\n\n**5. VISUAL EFFECTS:**\n*   **Depth of Field:** Exaggerated shallow depth of field, with the subject and the immediate part of the train he's on in sharp focus, and the rest of the train and background heavily blurred (bokeh effect).\n*   **Glow/Highlight:** A subtle bloom effect or glow on the brightest highlights, particularly on metal surfaces of the train or highlights on the subject.\n*   **Vignette:** A subtle, dark vignette around the edges of the frame to draw the viewer's eye towards the center and the main subject.\n\n**6. EMOTIONAL IMPACT:**\n*   **Primary Emotions:** Curiosity (\"What happens next?\"), Thrill/Excitement (the daring nature of the stunt), Danger/Suspense.\n*   **Facial Expression (Reiteration):** Crucial for conveying emotion. Ensure the subject's face clearly shows intense concentration, shock, or a yell of exertion/excitement.\n*   **Body Language (Reiteration):** Tensed, dynamic, conveying effort and the precariousness of the situation.\n\n**7. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION:**\n*   Ensure the subject's face and the core action are large and clear enough to be easily discernible even when the thumbnail is viewed at very small sizes on a mobile device.\n*   Text (if used) must be highly legible.\n*   Avoid critical elements in the bottom-right corner (timestamp overlay).\n\n**Summary for AI:** Generate a hyper-realistic, action-packed, high-contrast image of a man in a dynamic, tense pose on top of a vibrant yellow and black \"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY\" train. The man should exhibit a shocked/determined facial expression. Use a low-angle shot, dramatic lighting with rim lights, and intense motion blur on the train and background to convey speed and danger. The background should be heavily blurred (bokeh). Optional: Add large, bold text like \"RISKY JUMP!\" in white/yellow with a black outline at the top. The overall mood should be thrilling and suspenseful.",

      "prompt": "**TRANSFORMATION PROMPT:**\n\n\"Generate a hyper-realistic, high-energy YouTube thumbnail in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The central subject is a man in his late 20s to early 30s, wearing a dark grey or black jacket, beige/khaki pants, and a light-colored baseball cap worn forwards. He is captured in a dynamic, athletic wide stance (legs spread, knees slightly bent, arms slightly out for balance) on the flat, dark grey roof section of a vibrant, sunshine-yellow locomotive. The locomotive has bold, horizontal black stripes and clearly legible \"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY\" text in a strong, black, capitalized sans-serif font on its side.\n\n**Focal Point & Composition:**\nThe man is the primary focal point, tack-sharp, and positioned slightly to the right of the center, adhering to the rule of thirds (specifically, his body mass centered around the top-right intersection). He should appear slightly larger and more prominent than in the original frame. His pose should emphasize stability and anticipation.\n\n**Background & Motion:**\nThe background (consisting of out-of-focus green trees, a few indistinct farm animals, a distant utility pole, and a slightly overcast but bright sky) must have a strong, convincing horizontal motion blur applied, streaking from left to right, to convey the train is moving at high speed. The background elements should be significantly desaturated (by about 40-50%) compared to the vibrant train and man, creating depth and making the subject pop.\n\n**Lighting & Color:**\nThe lighting should be bright and slightly dramatic, simulating overcast daylight, with subtle highlights on the man's shoulders and the edges of the train. Enhance the yellow of the train to be extremely vibrant (e.g., #FFD700) and the black stripes to be deep and rich. Increase overall image contrast by 20-30% for a punchy look. The sky should be bright, perhaps with hints of blue breaking through clouds, but not overly saturated.\n\n**Visual Enhancements & Effects:**\n1.  **Subject Separation:** Apply a very subtle, soft white rim light (1-2 pixels wide, 50% opacity) around the man's silhouette to further separate him from the train and the blurred background.\n2.  **Clarity & Detail:** Sharpen the details of the man's clothing and the train's texture.\n3.  **Vignette:** Add a very subtle, dark vignette (10% opacity) around the extreme edges of the frame to draw the eye to the center.\n4.  **Color Grading:** Apply a subtle teal-and-orange color grade, pushing yellows/oranges in the train and subject, and blues/teals in the sky and shadows slightly, to create a cinematic, action-oriented feel.\n\n**Emotional Impact & Style:**\nThe thumbnail should evoke feelings of **curiosity, intrigue, and awe** regarding the dangerous and unusual situation. The style should be polished, professional, and highly engaging, similar to popular \"extreme experiment\" or \"challenge\" videos, but with a touch of cinematic realism.\n\n**Mobile Optimization:**\nEnsure the man and the train are clearly distinguishable and impactful even when the thumbnail is viewed at a very small size on a mobile device.

The primary focal point is a male figure in mid-air, appearing to be in the process of jumping from an unseen elevated point (like a bridge or platform edge, implied off-screen to the left) towards a speeding freight train moving from left to right across the frame. The train should occupy the middle ground, with its side prominently visible.\n\n**Main Subject (Jumper):**\nThe male figure should be dressed in bright, contrasting athletic wear (e.g., a vibrant yellow hoodie and dark pants, or a red jacket) to stand out. His pose should be dynamic and athletic \u2013 mid-leap, one leg extended forward, the other tucked, arms out for balance or reaching towards the train. His facial expression, clearly visible and well-lit, should be a mix of intense concentration, adrenaline, and a hint of 'oh crap!' surprise or thrill \u2013 wide eyes, gritted teeth or mouth slightly agape. Add subtle motion blur to his limbs furthest from the camera to enhance the sense of movement.\n\n**Train Details:**\nThe train should be a long, modern freight train (e.g., with shipping containers or boxcars), appearing to move at high speed. Emphasize this speed with significant horizontal motion blur on the train itself and its wheels. Details like rivets, grates, and lettering on the train should be visible but slightly blurred by motion. The train's color should contrast with the jumper, perhaps a dark blue, grey, or rust-colored.\n\n**Background & Environment:**\nThe background should be a slightly blurred rural or industrial landscape passing by quickly, reinforcing the train's speed. The sky should be dramatic, perhaps a late afternoon with dynamic clouds and warm sunlight catching the highlights on the jumper and train, creating strong rim lighting on the jumper to separate him from the background. Apply a depth of field effect, keeping the jumper and the closest part of the train sharp, with the background and distant parts of the train progressively more blurred.\n\n**Lighting & Color:**\nOverall lighting should be bright, vibrant, and high-contrast, typical of engaging YouTube thumbnails. Use strong key light to illuminate the jumper's face and front. Enhance colors to be slightly more saturated than reality. The color palette should be attention-grabbing: primary colors like yellow or red for the jumper, contrasting with blues/greys for the train and greens/browns for the blurred background. Add a subtle cool color grade to the shadows and warm highlights.\n\n**Text & Graphics (Optional but Recommended):**\nIf text is added, use a bold, highly readable sans-serif font (like 'Impact' or 'Bebas Neue'). Text: 'TRAIN JUMP?!' or 'CAN HE MAKE IT?!' in all caps. Color: Bright white or yellow text with a thick black outline and a slight drop shadow for maximum pop. Position it in the top third or bottom third of the frame, ensuring it doesn't obscure the main action or the jumper's face. Avoid the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Visual Effects:**\n-   Subtle speed lines/whoosh effects emanating from the train and trailing slightly behind the jumper.\n-   A slight lens flare effect from the sun if it's in frame or just out of frame, adding to the dynamism.\n-   A very subtle vignette to draw focus to the center.\n\n**Emotional Impact:**\nThe thumbnail must evoke intense curiosity, thrill, and a sense of danger/awe. The jumper's expression is key. The scale of the train versus the person should also contribute to the 'awe' factor.\n\n**Final Polish:**\nEnsure the overall image is sharp where it needs to be (jumper, immediate train section) and easily understandable at small thumbnail sizes.

Change his current static pose to a dynamic action pose: he is mid-air, jumping downwards, body angled towards the lower-left of the frame. His right arm is extended forward for balance, left arm slightly back. His head is turned to look intensely downwards and slightly forward, towards the implied train.\n2.  **Facial Expression:** Transform his facial expression to one of extreme shock and adrenaline. Eyes wide open with pupils slightly dilated, eyebrows raised in alarm, mouth slightly open as if gasping or shouting. Add visible strain and tension in his facial muscles.\n3.  **Clothing Details:** Retain his beige baseball cap (turned slightly askew by the wind/motion) and dark puffer jacket. Add subtle motion blur and fabric ripples to his jacket and cap to indicate fast movement and wind.\n\n**Background & Scene (Complete Replacement):**\n1.  **Setting:** Replace the original background entirely. The new scene is a low-angle shot looking slightly up from alongside train tracks, as if the viewer is trackside. A long, modern freight train (dark grey or blue metal, possibly with some yellow safety stripes or subtle graffiti) is speeding from the middle-right background towards the lower-left foreground, creating strong diagonal lines and perspective. The train should appear massive and powerful.\n2.  **Train Details:** The train is in motion, with significant motion blur applied to its wheels and the ground/ballast immediately around the tracks. Show sparks flying from the wheels on the tracks. One or two bright LED headlights on the train should be visible, casting a slight lens flare.\n3.  **Environment:** The area around the tracks should be industrial or a gritty urban outskirts setting. Include elements like a concrete embankment or a rusty metal fence in the periphery, also showing some motion blur.\n4.  **Sky:** A dramatic, overcast sky with dynamic clouds, perhaps with a hint of a setting sun breaking through, casting orange/golden highlights, contrasting with cooler blues and greys.\n\n**Composition & Framing:**\n1.  **Man's Placement:** The man (mid-jump) occupies the upper-middle to upper-right third of the frame, clearly jumping *towards* the path of the oncoming train.

Subtle motion blur streaks around the jumping man to indicate his velocity.\n2.  **Depth of Field:** Shallow depth of field. The man is in sharp focus. The closest part of the train is relatively sharp, becoming progressively more blurred further back. The distant background is heavily blurred.\n3.  **Sparks & Debris:** Add realistic sparks flying from the train wheels hitting the tracks. Maybe a few small pieces of dust/debris in the air around the man due to the wind.\n4.  **Lens Flare:** A subtle anamorphic lens flare from the train's headlights.\n5.  **Vignette:** A subtle dark vignette around the edges to draw focus to the center action.\n6.  **Glow:** Soft glow effect on the brightest highlights (sparks, headlights).\n\n**Text Elements (Optional but Recommended):**\n1.  **Content:** \"TRAIN JUMP?!\" or \"HE JUMPED!\"\n2.  **Font:** Very bold, impactful, sans-serif font (e.g., \"Bebas Neue Bold\" or \"Anton\").\n3.  **Size & Placement:** Large, placed in the upper-left or lower-right quadrant (avoiding timestamp area if bottom-right). Slightly angled for dynamism.\n4.  **Color & Style:** Bright yellow or white text with a thick black outline and a subtle drop shadow for maximum readability and pop against the busy background.\n\n**Overall Impression:** The thumbnail must evoke immediate curiosity, danger, and awe, making viewers click to see the outcome of this \"test.\" The man's expression should be the key emotional hook.\"",

      "prompt": "**TRANSFORMATION PROMPT:**\n\n\"Create a hyper-realistic, high-action YouTube thumbnail, 16:9 aspect ratio, designed for maximum click-through rate for a video titled 'Testing What Happens If You Jump On A Moving Train'.\n\n**1. Scene Composition & Focal Point:**\n   - **Subject:** A dynamic, athletic male figure in mid-air, milliseconds from landing or impacting the side of an ultra-modern, sleek bullet train. The figure should be positioned on the left third of the frame, angled towards the train.\n   - **Train:** The bullet train is depicted moving at extreme speed from right to left, occupying the central and right two-thirds of the frame. Show clear motion blur on the train's body and the tracks/environment beneath it, but keep the point of potential impact relatively sharp.\n   - **Perspective:** Low-angle shot, looking slightly up at the figure and the imposing train, enhancing the scale and danger.\n   - **Impact Area:** Subtly highlight the area where the figure is about to connect with the train \u2013 perhaps with a slight visual distortion, air ripple, or a glint on the train.\n\n**2. Visual Elements & Style:**\n   - **Figure Details:** The figure should wear practical, modern athletic clothing (e.g., dark joggers, a fitted hoodie). Their pose should be one of extreme exertion and anticipation \u2013 limbs tensed, body braced for impact. If face is partially visible, show intense focus or a grimace of effort.\n   - **Train Details:** The train should look futuristic and powerful (e.g., similar to a Shinkansen or Maglev), with a polished, reflective surface.\n   - **Background:** A heavily motion-blurred background suggesting a rural or industrial environment whizzing by at incredible speed \u2013 greens, greys, and blues streaked horizontally. Add strong speed lines emanating from the train and figure.\n   - **Foreground:** Minimal, perhaps the blurred edge of a platform or structure the figure jumped from, quickly falling away in the bottom-left corner.\n\n**3. Color & Lighting:**\n   - **Overall Mood:** Intense, dramatic, slightly dangerous, evoking awe and curiosity.\n   - **Color Palette:** High contrast. Use cool blues and greys for the train and background streaks, contrasted with a warmer, attention-grabbing color for a detail on the figure (e.g., red shoes, a yellow stripe on clothing) or a dramatic sky.\n   - **Lighting:** Cinematic, dramatic lighting. Employ strong rim lighting on the figure and the edge of the train, perhaps from a setting sun (golden hour hues \u2013 deep oranges, purples in the sky) or harsh industrial lights if an urban setting. This will make the subjects pop from the background. Ensure high contrast between light and shadow.\n\n**4. Text & Typography:**\n   - **Primary Text:** \"767 MPH\"\n     - **Font:** Bebas Neue Bold (or a similar impactful, condensed sans-serif font).\n     - **Size:** Very large, occupying a significant portion of either the top-center or bottom-center (avoiding bottom-right).\n     - **Color:** Bright white (#FFFFFF) or vibrant yellow (#FFFF00).\n     - **Effects:** Thick black (2-3px) outline AND a subtle dark drop shadow (75% opacity, 5px blur, 5px distance, angle 135 degrees) for maximum readability against any background.\n   - **Secondary Text (Optional, smaller):** \"THE JUMP\" or \"IMPACT!\"\n     - **Font:** Montserrat Medium.\n     - **Size:** Roughly 30-40% the size of the primary text.\n     - **Color:** Contrasting the primary, e.g., if primary is white, this could be a lighter shade of the train's accent color.\n     - **Positioning:** Directly below or slightly offset from the primary text.\n\n**5. Visual Effects & Details:**\n   - **Motion Blur:** Essential on the train and background to convey speed. Radial blur emanating subtly from the point of impending impact.\n   - **Depth of Field:** Shallow depth of field, keeping the figure and the immediate section of the train sharp, with the rest falling into blur.\n   - **Particles:** Include subtle sparks or debris being kicked up from the train's wheels or the air around the figure, enhancing the sense of speed and force.\n   - **Vignette:** Apply a subtle dark vignette around the edges to draw the viewer's eye to the central action.\n   - **Texture:** Add a very subtle grunge or metallic texture overlay (5-10% opacity, blend mode: overlay) to enhance realism and grittiness.\n\n**6. Emotional Impact & Engagement:**\n   - **Primary Emotions:** Awe (at the speed and audacity), Curiosity (what will happen?), Tension/Suspense.\n   - **Focal Point for Cues:** The figure's determined or braced posture and the sheer speed of the train should guide the eye.\n   - **Intrigue:** The \"767 MPH\" text combined with the impossible action creates an immediate information gap and question.\n\n**7. Optimization:**\n   - Ensure the figure and \"767 MPH\" text are clearly legible and impactful even when the thumbnail is viewed at very small sizes on mobile devices.\n   - Avoid placing critical elements in the bottom-right corner (timestamp overlay).\n   - Composition should feel balanced yet dynamic.\"",
