      "prompt": "TRANSFORMATION PROMPT:\n\nRecreate the provided image for a high-impact YouTube thumbnail titled \"Testing What Happens If You Jump On A Moving Train.\" The final image should evoke strong **curiosity** and **intrigue**.\n\n**1. MAIN SUBJECT & COMPOSITION:**\n    *   **Focal Point:** The man on top of the train. Enhance his presence.\n    *   **Pose & Emotion:** The man should be in a dynamic, slightly off-balance bracing stance, as if he just landed or is fighting to maintain balance on the speeding train. His facial expression should be clearly visible and convey a mix of intense concentration, surprise, and a hint of \"what have I gotten myself into?\" (e.g., wide eyes, tense jaw).\n    *   **Enhancements:** Sharpen the man's details significantly. Make his clothing (beige pants, dark jacket, light cap) pop against the train and background.\n    *   **Positioning:** Place the man slightly to the left or right of the center, adhering to the rule of thirds, to create visual interest. Ensure he is looking slightly forward or towards the camera with the aforementioned expression.\n\n**2. TRAIN & MOTION:**\n    *   **Train Details:** The yellow \"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY\" train should be vibrant. The yellow (#FFD700) and black stripes must be highly contrasted.\n    *   **Motion Blur:** Apply significant linear motion blur to the train itself, more pronounced towards the front and rear, suggesting high speed. The area directly under and around the man can be slightly less blurred to keep him anchored, but the overall effect should be of rapid movement.\n    *   **Perspective:** Maintain the current side-angle view of the train, enhancing the sense of speed.\n\n**3. BACKGROUND & ATMOSPHERE:**\n    *   **Background Treatment:** The background (rural landscape, trees, sheds) must be heavily blurred with motion blur, streaking horizontally to match the train's movement. Desaturate the background by 40-50% to make the subject and train stand out dramatically.\n    *   **Sky:** Transform the sky into a more dramatic, slightly overcast but bright sky, perhaps with dynamic cloud streaks also hinting at motion. Avoid a plain, dull sky.\n\n**4. COLOR & LIGHTING:**\n    *   **Overall Palette:** Vibrant yellows, deep blacks, and contrasting cool tones for the sky/desaturated background.\n    *   **Contrast:** Significantly increase the overall contrast of the image. Deepen shadows and brighten highlights, especially on the man and the train.\n    *   **Lighting on Subject:** Add a subtle rim light to the man, especially on his left side (camera right), to separate him from the background and train. Ensure his face is well-lit and expressive.\n    *   **Color Grading:** Apply a subtle \"action movie\" color grade \u2013 slightly cool shadows and warm highlights, or a high-contrast cinematic look. Make the train's yellow extremely punchy.\n\n**5. VISUAL EFFECTS & TEXT:**\n    *   **Sharpness & Clarity:** The man and the immediate part of the train he's standing on should be exceptionally sharp.\n    *   **Subtle Effects:** Consider adding very subtle, stylized speed lines or wind effects around the man and the edges of the train to further emphasize speed and danger, but these should not be cartoony.\n    *   **Vignette:** Apply a subtle dark vignette around the edges of the frame to draw the viewer's eye to the central action.\n    *   **Text (Optional but Recommended for Curiosity):**\n        *   **Content:** \"WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?!\" or \"RISKY JUMP!\"\n        *   **Font:** Use a very bold, sans-serif font (e.g., \"Impact\", \"Bebas Neue\", or \"Montserrat ExtraBold\").\n        *   **Style:** White text with a thick black outline and a slight drop shadow for maximum readability.\n        *   **Size:** Large enough to be easily readable on small thumbnail sizes.\n        *   **Positioning:** Place it in the top third of the image, likely top-left or top-center, ensuring it doesn't obscure the man's face or critical action. Avoid the bottom-right corner.\n\n**6. FINAL OUTPUT CONSIDERATIONS:**\n    *   **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9.\n    *   **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure the man's face and the core action are clearly discernible even when the thumbnail is viewed at a very small size. High contrast is key here.\n    *   **Emotional Impact:** The final image must scream \"danger,\" \"unpredictability,\" and \"must-click curiosity.\" The viewer should immediately wonder about the outcome of this precarious situation.",

      "prompt": "Transform the provided image frame of a person standing on a moving yellow \"Sierra Northern Railway\" train into a high-performing YouTube thumbnail for a video titled \"Testing What Happens If You Jump On A Moving Train\".\n\n**1. Subject Enhancement (Person):**\n    a.  Carefully isolate the person from the train roof and background.\n    b.  Increase their scale by approximately 20-25% to make them a dominant focal point.\n    c.  Subtly adjust their pose to be more dynamic: slightly leaning forward as if bracing against wind/motion, arms slightly more outstretched for balance, enhancing the sense of precariousness and action. Ensure the wide-legged stance is maintained.\n    d.  Dramatically sharpen the subject, ensuring all clothing details are crisp.\n    e.  Add a subtle, bright white rim light around the subject's outline, particularly on the side facing the implied light source (e.g., upper left), to make them pop from the train and background.\n\n**2. Train Enhancement (Yellow Locomotive):**\n    a.  Boost the saturation and vibrancy of the train's yellow, making it rich and eye-catching.\n    b.  Increase local contrast on the train's body, especially the black stripes and the \"SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY\" lettering, ensuring the text is exceptionally clear and legible.\n    c.  Keep the train relatively sharp, but slightly less so than the main subject to create a subtle depth hierarchy.\n\n**3. Background Treatment:**\n    a.  Apply a strong, directional horizontal motion blur to all background elements (trees, distant white freight car, ground, fences, and sky). The blur intensity should be high enough to suggest significant speed, making individual details indistinct but maintaining general shapes and colors.\n    b.  Slightly desaturate the motion-blurred background by 25-35% and subtly darken it to push it back visually and maximize the contrast with the vibrant yellow train and the subject.\n    c.  If the sky area is prominent after blur, give it a slightly cooler, more dramatic tone (e.g., a desaturated cyan or deeper blue).\n\n**4. Overall Composition, Color, and Lighting:**\n    a.  Re-compose if necessary to place the subject on a key intersection of the rule of thirds, likely the left or right vertical third, to enhance visual interest.\n    b.  Globally, increase contrast: deepen shadows (especially under the train and subtle cast shadows from the subject) and brighten highlights (on metallic parts of the train, subject's highlights).\n    c.  Apply a subtle color grade: Slightly warm the overall image, particularly enhancing the yellows and skin tones, while keeping blues/cyans in the distant background cool for color contrast. Aim for a \"cinematic action\" feel.\n    d.  Add a very subtle dark vignette to the extreme edges of the frame to draw focus inwards.\n\n**5. Text Overlay:**\n    a.  Text Content: \"EXTREME\" (first line, slightly smaller), \"TRAIN JUMP!\" (second line, larger and more prominent).\n    b.  Font: Bebas Neue ExtraBold (or a similar very bold, condensed, highly legible sans-serif like Montserrat Black).\n    c.  Text Color: Bright, solid white (#FFFFFF).\n    d.  Text Effects:\n        i.  Outline: A 3-4 pixel solid black (#000000) outline.\n        ii. Drop Shadow: A soft black drop shadow (Opacity: 60-70%, Angle: ~135 degrees, Distance: 5-8 pixels, Size/Blur: 8-10 pixels) to lift text off complex backgrounds.\n    e.  Text Positioning: Place the stacked text in the upper-left quadrant or top-center of the thumbnail. Ensure it doesn't obscure the subject's face or critical action. The text block should be large and impactful, easily readable at small sizes. Potentially give the text a slight upward angle (5-10 degrees) for dynamism.\n\n**6. Final Polish for Impact and Clarity:**\n    a.  The final image must convey intense action, risk, and curiosity.\n    b.  Ensure the subject's silhouette is clearly defined against the train and background.\n    c.  Perform a final sharpness pass, focusing on the subject\u2019s eyes (if visible) and key features, and the train's primary branding.\n    d.  Verify that all critical elements (subject, train, text) are clearly visible and understandable when the thumbnail is viewed at a very small size (e.g., 160x90 pixels).

      "prompt": "**Transformation Prompt:**\n\n\"Create a hyper-dynamic, high-contrast YouTube thumbnail image, 16:9 aspect ratio, for a video titled 'Testing What Happens If You Jump On A Moving Train.'\n\n**Scene Description:** A thrilling, action-packed moment frozen in time. A figure is captured mid-jump, attempting to land on the side or roof of an extremely fast-moving, modern bullet train. The perspective is a slightly low three-quarter angle, looking up at the figure and along the length of the train, emphasizing the speed and danger.\n\n**Key Subjects & Actions:**\n1.  **Jumping Figure:**\n    *   **Appearance:** Stylized human silhouette or a figure in athletic wear (e.g., hoodie, jeans, sneakers), with features obscured or minimally detailed to maintain focus on the action. The figure should be dynamic, body tensed in a jump, legs tucked or extended, arms reaching out towards the train.\n    *   **Emotion (implied by body language):** Intense determination, focus, and a hint of recklessness or extreme effort.\n    *   **Enhancement:** Make the figure pop with a bright outline (e.g., neon yellow or electric blue, 2-3px thick) or a rim light.\n2.  **Train:**\n    *   **Type:** Sleek, modern bullet train (e.g., Shinkansen style), appearing very long and fast.\n    *   **Detail:** Metallic surface with subtle reflections, possibly some light weathering or grime to add realism.\n    *   **Motion:** The train is heavily motion-blurred horizontally to convey extreme speed, with sharp leading edges.\n\n**Composition & Framing:**\n*   **Focal Point:** The jumping figure and the point of potential impact/landing on the train. This should be slightly off-center, following the rule of thirds (e.g., figure on the left vertical third, train occupying the lower two-thirds horizontally).\n*   **Directional Cues:** The figure's jump trajectory and the train's motion lines should guide the eye from left-to-right or vice-versa, creating a strong sense of movement.\n*   **Negative Space:** Use blurred background elements to ensure the figure and train stand out.\n*   **Angle:** Low angle shot, making the train and the jump appear more imposing and dramatic.\n\n**Visual Style & Mood:**\n*   **Style:** Cinematic, action-oriented, slightly gritty but polished. Avoid overly cartoonish or photorealistic styles; aim for a high-impact graphic novel feel.\n*   **Mood:** Excitement, danger, suspense, awe-inspiring speed.\n\n**Lighting & Color:**\n*   **Overall Lighting:** Dramatic, high contrast. Strong key light from one side (e.g., late afternoon sun or artificial trackside lighting) creating bright highlights and deep shadows, emphasizing form and speed.\n*   **Color Palette:**\n    *   **Figure:** If not a silhouette, a contrasting color like bright red or orange for clothing, or a strong, bright outline.\n    *   **Train:** Cool metallic colors (dark silver, gunmetal grey, deep blue) with bright specular highlights.\n    *   **Background:** Desaturated blues, greys, and motion-blurred colors of the environment (e.g., green/brown for landscape, grey for sky).\n    *   **Accents:** Streaks of bright light (white, light yellow) for speed lines emanating from the train and around the figure.\n*   **Contrast:** Maximize contrast between the figure and the train, and the train and the background.\n\n**Text & Typography:**\n*   **Text Content:** \"767 MPH\" (primary, large) and subtly underneath or next to it \"(1234 km/h)\" (secondary, smaller).\n*   **Font:** Ultra-bold, impactful, sans-serif font (e.g., \"Bebas Neue Bold,\" \"Anton,\" \"Impact\").\n*   **Color & Effects:** Bright white or vibrant yellow text. Apply a thick, dark (black or very dark grey) outline (stroke of 3-4px) and a subtle drop shadow to make it pop against the dynamic background.\n*   **Positioning:** Place the text in the upper left or upper center quadrant, angled slightly to match the motion/dynamics of the scene. Ensure it doesn't obscure the main action and is clear of the bottom-right timestamp area.\n*   **Integration:** The text should feel integrated, perhaps with slight motion blur applied in the same direction as the train if it complements the composition.\n\n**Visual Effects:**\n*   **Motion Blur:** Extreme horizontal motion blur for the train and background. The jumping figure should be relatively sharp, or with minimal directional blur to indicate their own movement.\n*   **Speed Lines:** Dynamic, sharp streaks of light and air distortion around the train and potentially trailing the figure to amplify the sense of speed.\n*   **Depth of Field:** Shallow depth of field, keeping the jumping figure and the immediate section of the train they are targeting in sharp focus, while the rest of the train and background fall off into blur.\n*   **Particles/Debris:** Subtle sparks or dust particles being kicked up or trailing the train.\n*   **Vignette:** A subtle dark vignette around the edges to draw focus to the central action.\n*   **Edge Glow/Highlights:** Sharp highlights on the edges of the train and figure facing the light source.\n\n**Mobile Optimization:**\n*   The jumping figure and the train's form must be clearly distinguishable even at small thumbnail sizes.\n*   The text \"767 MPH\" must be easily readable.\n*   The core action should be impactful and centrally visible.\n\n**Final Check:** The image should scream 'speed,' 'danger,' and 'extreme test,' making viewers instantly curious about what happens.\"",
